    "## <font color=\"dark blue\">WHAT IS EDA?<font color/>\n",
    "- It is an approach to analys the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary & graphical representations.\n",
    "- EDA is the foundation stone, a very vital step before begin with data analysis.\n",
    "- EDA is like an investigation carried out by a detective.\n",
    "- The better you know your data(have more clues), the better is your analysis(case outcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color=\"dark blue\">OBJECTIVE OF EDA<font color/>\n",
    "- Confirm if the data is making sense in the context of the bussines problem.\n",
    "- Uncover & resolve data quality issues.\n",
    "- Get information about the data summary.\n",
    "- Detect outliers & anomalies(Many times some values lie far away from standard set of values, these are called Anomalies).\n",
    "- Understand data patterns & correlations between variables.\n",
    "- Drop unwanted columns & derive new variables.\n",

    "## <font color=\"dark blue\">TYPES OF EDA<font color/>\n",
    "### <font color=\"blue\">1. UNVARIATE ANALYSIS:<font color/>\n",
    "- If we take one feature at a time & analysis it, then it is called as Univariate Analysis.\n",
    "- The main purpose of Univariate analysis is to detect the Outliers, Null values, Normally distributed or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __CATEGORICAL DATA TYPE__:\n",
    "> - If the feature is Categorical then we use Bar Chart, Pie chart for the visualization.\n",
    "> - If the feature is Categorical then we use frequency table for the non-visualization.\n",
    "<br> \n",
    " \n",
    "> __NUMERICAL DATA TYPE__:\n",
    "> - If the feature is Numerical then we use Box plot for outlier detection, Histogram to see which type of Distribution is it.\n",
    "> If the feature is Numerical then we use Percentile for Outlier detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### <font color=\"blue\">2. BIVARIATE ANALYSIS:<font color/>\n",
    "- If we take two features at a time & analysis it, then it is called as Bivariate Analysis.\n",
    "- The main purpose of Bivariate analysis is to check the relationship between two features.\n",
    "   \n",
    "> __NUMERIC vs NUMERIC DATA TYPE__:\n",
    "> - If the two features are Numerical then we use Scatter plot to see the relationship between them.\n",
    "<br>   \n",
    "\n",
    "> __NUMERIC vs CATEGORICAL DATA TYPE__:\n",
    "> - If the one feature is Numeric & another is Categorical then we use Box plot to see the relationship between them.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "> __CATEGORICAL vs CATEGORICAL DATA TYPE__:\n",
    "> - If the two features are CATEGORICAL then we use Stacked Bar Plot/ Grouped Bar Plot to see the relationship between them."
